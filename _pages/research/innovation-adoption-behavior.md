This research explores the behavioral dynamics that drive or hinder the adoption of innovations, “_an idea, practice, or object that is perceived as new by an individual or another unit of adoption_” ([Rogers’ theory of Diffusion of Innovations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations)). My recent work centers on the adoption of alternative fuels and zero-emission technologies in the heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) sector. While HDVs are the current focus, the frameworks and approaches are adaptable to other technologies and sectors.

## Building a Theory of Alternative Fuel Adoption Behavior of Heavy-duty Vehicle Fleets
Revealing heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) fleet operators’ attitudes, preferences, and behavior towards alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) is essential to understand the demand-side aspects of AFV adoption in the HDV sector. Such understanding can contribute to more facilitated diffusion of heavy-duty AFVs, which can lead to the mitigation of climate change and improved local air quality. This study aims to build a theory regarding AFV adoption behavior in HDV fleets. To this end, a comprehensive literature review was conducted, including existing theories and frameworks, and 34 peer-reviewed articles encompassing both light-duty vehicle fleets (e.g., taxi, vans, and pickup trucks) and HDV (e.g., long- or short-haul trucks, transit buses, refuse trucks, sweepers, and vocational trucks) fleets. By synthesizing the findings from the literature review, and examining and re-designing existing theories, we developed a preliminary theoretical framework to conceptually explain AFV fleet adoption behavior in organizations that operate light-duty and/or heavy-duty vehicle fleets. The proposed framework consists of two levels of sub-frameworks, at the decision-making unit level and the individual (e.g., fleet drivers) acceptance level, as well as a five-stage adoption process: awareness, consideration, adoption decision, implementation, and confirmation.

## Factors influencing alternative fuel adoption decisions in heavy-duty vehicle fleets
Understanding heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) fleet operator behavior with respect to adoption of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) is critically important for accelerating diffusion of these technologies, and for achieving societal benefits through reduced emissions and improved public health. However, fleet operator perspectives have thus far received limited attention, leaving a key knowledge gap. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring HDV fleet operator decisions about alternative fuel adoption using both existing literature and new empirical data. To this end, we first develop an initial theoretical framework of AFV fleet adoption behavior in organizations based upon existing theories and literature. We then empirically improve the framework by investigating 20 organizations in California via in-depth qualitative interviews and project reports. A total of 29 adoption and 42 non-adoption cases were probed across various alternative fuel technologies, including natural gas, propane, electricity, hydrogen, biodiesel, and renewable diesel options. Content analysis of the qualitative data yielded 38 motivators or barriers related to AFV adoption, encompassing perceived technological characteristics, organization characteristics, and external environmental influences. The study results contribute theoretically and empirically to a better understanding of the demand-side aspects of AFV adoption by HDV fleet operators, particularly in California and in the other US states that follow California’s environmental policies.

## Organizational Decision-making Processes of Alternative Fuel Adoption
Adoption of alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) fleets can bring substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and criteria air pollutants, which can thus help mitigate climate change and improve local air quality. A better understanding of demand-side characteristics of the AFV fleet market is crucial to foster the transition towards zero-emission transportation. However, there is a scant body of literature of the AFV fleet adoption area, particularly in the heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) sector. This study explored the decision-making processes of alternative fuel adoption in organizations that have made a decision to adopt or to not adopt heavy-duty AFVs in California. Based on semi-structured qualitative interviews with 18 organizations, followed by thematic analysis, specific decision-making steps were explored in depth, four distinct patterns of the decision processes were discussed, and challenges and facilitators underlying the processes were identified. The study findings serve as the first step towards enhancing our understanding of organizational decision-making processes of heavy-duty AFV adoption, which can contribute to formulating effective policy strategies aiming rapid and wide diffusion of AFVs throughout the entire HDV market.
