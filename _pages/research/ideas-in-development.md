I'm currently exploring several early-stage ideas that could shape my future research. Some are still just sketches, others might turn into formal proposals, or even side projects I work on for fun. If you find any of these interesting, I welcome feedback and discussions.

### Transfer Learning for Vehicle Choice Models
Modeling technology adoption in the heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) sector is challenging due to heterogeneous fleet segments and limited data across them. This project explores transfer learning to improve choice modeling by adapting models built on rich datasets from one fleet segment (e.g., drayage fleets) to others (e.g., public or long-haul fleets), which would reduce the need for large datasets. The aim is to make behavioral modeling more scalable and cost-efficient across diverse HDV segments.

### Hybrid Choice Models with Fleet Perceptions and Organizational Factors 
Fleet decisions are not just about cost or technical specifications – they could be shaped by how decision-makers perceive new technologies and how their organizations operate. This project expands prior ZET adoption models by incorporating fleet operators’ perceptions on zero-emission trucks (ZETs) (e.g., perceived benefits, complexity) and organizational traits (e.g., environmental consciousness, risk tolerance). These behavioral insights can inform more effective outreach and communication strategies. The study also addresses a key knowledge gap in understanding how latent factors influence fleet decisions.

### Computational Text Analysis for Innovation Adoption
Qualitative data can be rich but hard to digest. This project applies computational text analysis and machine learning to analyze qualitative data and extract behavioral patterns from qualitative data to support theory-building in innovation adoption. It includes a case study that extends my AFV adoption framework to other sustainable transportation solutions. The approach promotes scalable, data-driven methods for analyzing adoption behavior.

### Impact of AI on Education and Research
How are faculty, researchers, and students using AI in their work? This project investigates AI use in teaching, research, and learning – especially in the interdisciplinary field of transportation. It explores usage patterns, opportunities, and concerns across different types of institutions and roles. The goal is to identify what support and policies are needed to responsibly and effectively integrate AI into academic environments.

### Zero-Emission Trucks in Disaster Management
This research investigates how zero-emission trucks could both pose risks and offer opportunities in disaster contexts. For example, it investigates safety concerns related to battery fires in battery-electric trucks, as well as their potential to serve as mobile energy storage units.  The project aims to develop a multi-stakeholder framework for resilient ZET operations across all phases of disaster management: preparedness, mitigation, responses, and recovery. 

### Multi-Scale Assessment of Technology Adoption Impacts: From Incentives to Air Quality, Health, and Lifecycle Emissions
This study evaluates how ZET purchase incentives influence adoption, regional air quality, public health, and lifecycle emissions. It integrates choice modeling (developed for the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach region), emissions modeling, health impact assessment, and lifecycle analysis. The project provides a unified framework for assessing the multi-dimensional impacts of ZET adoption. Findings will help quantify environmental and health benefits of incentive programs and inform guide more targeted, evidence-based policies.

### Learning from Experienced Fleets: Real-World Lessons
What can we learn from fleets that have already adopted – or seriously considered adopting – zero-emission trucks? This project builds on recent survey data to examine how fleet operators are navigating regulatory uncertainty and shifting market conditions. These case studies will reveal practical lessons and help design more practical, tailored adoption strategies across different fleet segments.
