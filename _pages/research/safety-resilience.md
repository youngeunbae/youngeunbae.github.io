This research addresses the safety and resilience of freight transportation systems. Iâ€™m currently analyzing truck crash data to understand how various factors relate to the incidence and severity of crashes and to investigate disparities in traffic safety between disadvantaged communities and other regions. In addition, my future directions include assessing the role of zero-emission trucks in disaster management to promote operational safety and disaster resilience.

## Analysis of Large Truck Crashes in California
Large trucks are indispensable for freight transportation and economic growth, but present notable safety challenges on roadways. In California, despite representing only 2.5% of vehicle population and 5.6% of vehicle miles traveled, large trucks accounted for 9.1% of fatal crashes in 2020, causing 372 deaths and 8,350 injuries. However, existing studies on truck crashes in California are outdated or limited in scope. Furthermore, research addressing truck crashes in disadvantaged communities is lacking. This project aims to fill these knowledge gaps by conducting a comprehensive exploratory analysis of large truck crashes using recent databases, including the Highway Safety Information System, the Motor Carrier Management Information System, the Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System, and CalEnviroScreen. Our research will focus on two primary objectives: 1. understanding the factors associated with frequency and severity of large truck crashes in California, and 2. examining the disparities in crash rates and severity between disadvantaged communities and other regions. Employing exploratory analysis techniques, supplemented by potential statistical modeling, we will investigate diverse factors, encompassing vehicle, driver, trucking company, infrastructure, and environmental attributes. The findings will significantly enhance our understanding of large truck crashes in California, offering valuable insights to inform traffic safety policy and promote equitable transportation planning.
