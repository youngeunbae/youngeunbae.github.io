This research examines infrastructure needs from the perspective of users, aiming to inform infrastructure planning and operational strategies. I currently focus on alternative fuel and charging infrastructure for heavy-duty fleets by integrating user behavior, operational compatibility, and policy context to support effective infrastructure deployment.

## Charging Infrastructure Decisions by Heavy-duty Vehicle Fleet Operators - An Exploratory Analysis
Insufficient charging/fueling infrastructure poses a major challenge to achieving U.S. policy goals for transitioning the heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) sector to zero-emission vehicles. Addressing the infrastructure needs of HDV fleet operators, who are key demand-side stakeholders, is crucial for developing effective solutions and strategies. This study investigates these needs through a fleet survey of Californiaâ€™s drayage sector, focusing on battery electric trucks. Key aspects examined include preferences for charging locations, access types, charging duration, time-of-day for charging, and innovative solutions like Truck-as-a-Service. Analyzing responses from 53 companies with varying fleet sizes, annual revenues, and operational characteristics, the study employed a comprehensive exploratory approach, utilizing descriptive analysis, thematic analysis, and hypothesis testing. Findings reveal that while most fleets preferred on-site charging, about a quarter, primarily smaller fleets with five or fewer trucks, preferred both on-site and off-site options. Private access was often favored for on-site facilities, though some respondents recognized the benefits of shared access for expanding operational coverage. The study also identified a need for faster charging solutions at both off-site and on-site locations, particularly for long-haul or mixed operations. Time-of-day preferences varied widely, driven by the need for efficient operations. Furthermore, a small proportion of participating fleets preferred Truck-as-a-Service over traditional procurement, predominantly among smaller fleets or those with lower revenues. The comprehensive research findings contribute to a deeper understanding of charging infrastructure needs and offer practical insights for policy practitioners and industry stakeholders committed to advancing zero-emission infrastructure.

## Fleet Operator Perspectives on Heavy-duty Vehicle Alternative Fueling Infrastructure
Despite the aggressive policy goals aiming to transition heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) toward zero-emission technologies, the penetration rates of zero-emission or even alternative fuel technologies (including zero-emission and other fuels cleaner than petroleum) are still very low. Given that the majority of HDVs are used as fleet vehicles, a better understanding of fleet operator behavior and perspectives on clean fuel technologies is crucial to develop effective demand-side strategies to achieve such policy goals. Of many adoption barriers, a well-known major obstacle is the lack of fueling/charging infrastructure. However, there is limited understanding on how HDV fleet operators have navigated the issues involving the insufficient infrastructure. This study explores how HDV fleets have used alternative fueling infrastructure, how dis/satisfied fleet operators are with the infrastructure, and for what reasons they have decided to construct their own on-site fueling facilities, or to use off-site stations. Based on a case study of compressed natural gas, the most prevalent alternative fuel option so far in the HDV sector, 17 in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with HDV fleet operators in California. Content and thematic analyses of the data yielded detailed qualitative inferences on use behavior, satisfaction, and fleet decisions between on-site versus off-site fueling. The study findings are the first step toward enhancing our understanding of HDV fleet behavior regarding alternative fueling infrastructure, which can contribute to filling the knowledge gap in this field and to developing further research questions to elicit policy recommendations that can support the adoption of clean fuel technologies in HDV fleets.
