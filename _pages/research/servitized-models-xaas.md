Servitized business models, where customers pay for a service rather than owning the underlying asset, are transforming how transportation technologies are adopted and used. These models – such as ride-hailing, mobility-as-a-service (MaaS), truck-as-a-service (TaaS), and charging-as-a-service (CaaS) – can help overcome barriers like high upfront costs and operational complexity. For instance, ride-hailing platforms have redefined access to personal mobility without car ownership, while TaaS and CaaS enable freight fleets to adopt zero-emission trucks and charging infrastructure through subscription-based offerings. My research explores how these service-based models are evolving, who benefits most, and how they can support broader transitions toward cleaner, more accessible transportation systems.

## Use of Ride-Hailing Services among Older Adults in the United States
This study explores how older adults in the U.S. use ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, using data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey. We focused on two key questions: What factors influence whether older adults try these services, and what factors affect how often they use them once they do? To answer this, we used a zero-inflated negative binomial model, which helps account for many people not using the service at all. We found that the characteristics of people who try ride-hailing services are different from those who become frequent users. Older adults who are younger within the senior age group, live alone, reside in urban areas, are more educated or affluent, or are men with health issues that limit their ability to drive are more likely to adopt ride-hailing. On the other hand, among those who adopt, more frequent users tend to be middle-aged seniors, less educated, or those without access to a car. Smartphone access also plays a key role. Those who own smartphones are more likely to use ride-hailing in the first place. Interestingly, we also found that older adults who use ride-hailing tend to take more transit trips than those who don’t, suggesting that these services may complement public transportation rather than replace it. These findings offer valuable insights for designing inclusive mobility strategies and for ride-hailing companies seeking to better serve older adults.

## Assessing the Role of Truck-as-a-Service in California’s Zero-emission Transition
While California aims to transition medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), HDV fleet operators face critical challenges in adopting ZEVs. These include high upfront costs for vehicle acquisition and infrastructure construction, and perceived operational and financial risks associated with ZEVs. To address these barriers, it is crucial to explore innovative ZEV procurement solutions beyond conventional methods. One such solution is Truck-as-a-Service (TaaS), a servitized model that has the potential to reduce total cost of ownership. However, the implications of TaaS on the ZEV transition remain largely unknown. Therefore, this research aims to comprehensively assess the role of TaaS in California’s ZEV transition from various perspectives. By enhancing an existing tool and leveraging fleet survey and interview data in ongoing projects, this research will explore diverse TaaS offerings, assess their cost-effectiveness across fleet segments, and analyze long-term implications on the overall fleet transition. Equity and job considerations will also be addressed, focusing on equity issues for disadvantaged fleets and implications for job creation and worker training. The research findings will significantly contribute to filling the knowledge gap in this field and generate practical insights for promoting ZEV adoption through innovative solutions.
