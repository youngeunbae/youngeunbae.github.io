Servitized business models, where customers pay for a service on a per-use basis, represent a shift from asset ownership to service consumption and have the potential to alleviate adoption barriers (e.g., reducing upfront costs and operational complexity). For example, truck-as-a-service (TaaS) or charging-as-a-service (CaaS) allows fleets to access zero-emission trucks and/or associated fueling or charging through a monthly fee. I study how these service offerings evolve, who benefits most, and their role in supporting technology transitions.

## Assessing the Role of Truck-as-a-Service in California’s Zero-emission Transition
While California aims to transition medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), HDV fleet operators face critical challenges in adopting ZEVs. These include high upfront costs for vehicle acquisition and infrastructure construction, and perceived operational and financial risks associated with ZEVs. To address these barriers, it is crucial to explore innovative ZEV procurement solutions beyond conventional methods. One such solution is Truck-as-a-Service (TaaS), a servitized model that has the potential to reduce total cost of ownership. However, the implications of TaaS on the ZEV transition remain largely unknown. Therefore, this research aims to comprehensively assess the role of TaaS in California’s ZEV transition from various perspectives. By enhancing an existing tool and leveraging fleet survey and interview data in ongoing projects, this research will explore diverse TaaS offerings, assess their cost-effectiveness across fleet segments, and analyze long-term implications on the overall fleet transition. Equity and job considerations will also be addressed, focusing on equity issues for disadvantaged fleets and implications for job creation and worker training. The research findings will significantly contribute to filling the knowledge gap in this field and generate practical insights for promoting ZEV adoption through innovative solutions.
