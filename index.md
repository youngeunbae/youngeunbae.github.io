Hello! I'm Youngeun, an Assistant Project Scientist at [the Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California, Irvine](https://ucits.org/). I'm passionate about shaping a more sustainable and resilient future through data-driven research that bridges theory and practice.

My work lies at the intersection of sustainable transportation systems, behavioral modeling, and policy and strategy analysis. I've primarily focused on understanding the behavioral dynamics behind innovation adoption, analyzing fleet transitions to zero-emission vehicles, and identifying infrastructure needs to support them. Looking ahead, I'm excited to expand my research into other emerging technologies (e.g., autonomous vehicles, AI) in transportation and engineering more broadly.

With research and professional experience across academia, government, and industry, I've led and collaborated on multi-partner projects that connect diverse stakeholders. These experiences have deepened my commitment to interdisciplinary research with real-world impact. I use a range of qualitative and quantitative methods, including interviews, surveys, choice experiments, statistical analysis, demand forecasting, vehicle emissions analysis, and total cost of ownership analysis, to tackle practical challenges and support real-world applications.

I welcome collaboration with researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders to advance impactful and practical solutions in transportation and beyond.
